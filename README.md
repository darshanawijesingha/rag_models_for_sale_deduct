## Overview
This repository contains methodologies and analyses for two critical aspects of retail management:

- **Inventory Analysis & Replenishment**: Predicting stock-outs and generating purchase orders.
- **Sales Performance Analysis**: Identifying items with the most significant positive and negative sales variances against their historical averages.

The goal is to provide actionable insights to optimize stock levels and understand sales trends.

## 1. Inventory Analysis & Replenishment
This system analyzes current stock levels against historical sales data to forecast potential out-of-stock (OOS) situations and generate replenishment instructions.

### Input Data Requirements
To perform the inventory analysis, the following data points are required for each Stock Keeping Unit (SKU):

- **Current Stock Level**: Quantity in the store at the start of the day.
- **Average Daily Sale (ADS)**: Historical average units sold per day.
- **Sales Until Now (SUN)**: Units sold from the start of the day until the current time.
- **Time of Analysis**: The current time of day is crucial for accurate projections.

### Analysis Methodology
1. **Calculate Sales Difference vs. Average**: `Sales Difference = (SUN) - (ADS * (Current Hour / Operating Hours))`
2. **Projected End-of-Day Sales (PEDS)**: `PEDS = (SUN / (Current Hour / Operating Hours))`
3. **Calculate Understock Quantity**: `Understock = PEDS - Current Stock`
4. **Generate Replenishment Instructions**: Based on the understock calculation and item status (e.g., "OUT OF STOCK" or "LOW STOCK"), decide on quantities to transfer from a warehouse or purchase from a supplier.

### Example Analysis
Based on a previous analysis of items at risk of stock-out.

## 2. Sales Performance Analysis
This analysis compares the current period's sales against a historical benchmark to identify the best and worst performers by sales variance.

### Input Data Requirements
- **Current Period Sales ($)**: Revenue generated per SKU for the period in question.
- **Benchmark Sales ($)**: Historical average revenue for the same SKU for a comparable period.
- **Sales Difference ($)**: `Current Period Sales - Benchmark Sales`

### Top Performers: Sales Gains
This list highlights products that are significantly outperforming their historical average.

**Analysis of Top Gains:**


### Underperformers: Sales Losses
This list highlights products that are significantly underperforming compared to their historical average. This signals a potential issue that requires immediate investigation.

**Analysis of Top Losses:**
- The largest loss is approximately -$12,000.
- **Action Required**: The specific SKUs are not fully named in the provided chart, but the management team must immediately investigate root causes such as stock availability, recent pricing changes, competitor activity, or quality issues.

## How to Use This Analysis
- **For Inventory**: Use the replenishment report daily to prioritize transfers and place purchase orders to avoid lost sales.
- **For Sales Gains**: Increase stock levels for top-gaining items to ensure availability.
- **For Sales Losses**: Investigate the root cause immediately and develop a corrective action plan.

## Implementation Notes
- **Automation**: These processes should be automated by integrating data from the Point-of-Sale (POS) and Inventory Management systems.
- **Frequency**: The inventory analysis should be run multiple times a day. The sales performance analysis can be run daily or weekly.
- **Context**: Always combine quantitative data with qualitative context for accurate interpretation.
